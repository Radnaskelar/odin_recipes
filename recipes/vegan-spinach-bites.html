    <h2>Popeye would be proud of you!</h2>
    <p>Want to feel strong, energized and healthy? Look no further and take a bite!</p>
    <p>Spinach bites that are allergen-friendly for my little guys. Flour keeps them from sticking and gives them a
        great crust
        on the outside. Baking dries up the spinach filling and prevents it from being too gooey.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound Idaho potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>2 bunches fresh spinach, divided
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided, or more as needed
        </li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flaxseed meal
        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
            until
            tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Run 1/2 cup spinach through a juicer according to manufacturer's instructions; add to cooled potatoes and
            mash until
            smooth.</li>
        <li>Pulse remaining spinach in a food processor until finely chopped. Add to mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until
            fragrant, about 5
            minutes. Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Stir into mashed potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix water and flaxseed meal together in a small bowl; let sit until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add to
            mashed potatoes
            with baking powder and salt; mix to combine. Form into patties. Dust both sides of patties generously with
            flour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in batches until a pale crust forms,
            about 3
            minutes per side. Repeat with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and patties. Transfer pan-fried patties to baking
            sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
