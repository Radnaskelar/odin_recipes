  <h2>Fun for parties, and personally better than regular sushi</h2>
  <p>An easily made, slight modification of an already delicious meal.
    All ingredients can be acquired at your nearest store. Healthy <em>and</em> delicious.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) package miniature marshmallows</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
    <li>½ (17.5 ounce) package crispy rice cereal (such as Rice Krispies®)</li>
    <li>3 square fruit rolls (such as General Mills® Fruit Roll-Ups)</li>
    <li>4 pieces red licorice</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine marshmallows and butter in a large saucepan over medium-low heat; cook and stir until melted, 5 to 10
      minutes.
      Stir rice cereal into marshmallow mixture until evenly coated. Remove saucepan from heat and cool mixture until
      easily
      handled, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Unroll fruit rolls onto a work surface. Cut licorice to fit the length of each fruit roll.</li>
    <li>Spoon rice mixture onto half of each fruit roll. Place a piece of licorice on top of 1 rice mixture edge.
      Starting on
      the licorice edge, roll fruit roll around rice mixture ending with the fruit roll edge without rice mixture to
      seal.
      Repeat with remaining fruit rolls.</li>
    <li>Dip a knife in water and slice 'sushi' into equal-size pieces.</li>
  </ol>
